Python program for escaping a maze using a breadth-first search algorithm.

Run the program with
`python escape_the_maze.py <maze> <max_length>`
where `<maze>` is a .txt-file and `<max_length>` the wanted max length of the escape path. The result will be printed to `result.txt`.

Example mazes can be found in the directory [mazes](mazes).
